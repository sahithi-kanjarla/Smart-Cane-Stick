# Smart-Cane-Stick
Overview
This project showcases a smart cane designed to enhance mobility and safety for individuals with visual impairments. The Smart Cane Stick utilizes Arduino Uno, an ultrasonic sensor, jumper wires, a battery, and a buzzer to provide real-time feedback about obstacles in the user's path.

Features
Obstacle Detection: The ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles in the vicinity of the user.
Real-Time Feedback: The Arduino Uno processes sensor data and triggers the buzzer to alert the user about obstacles.
Portable Design: Powered by a compact battery, making it easy to carry and use on the go.

How it Works
The ultrasonic sensor emits ultrasonic waves to detect obstacles.
Arduino Uno processes the sensor data, determining the distance to the obstacle.
If an obstacle is detected within a set range, the buzzer is triggered to alert the user
